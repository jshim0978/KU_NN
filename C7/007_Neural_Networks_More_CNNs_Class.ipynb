    "One solution for this is the so-called **dropout** - a technique proposed by Srivastava and Hinton in 2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea for this is actually very simple and implemented like a layer in Pytorch: in every iteration of the training, you zero out a random fraction of outputs of the preceding layer to reduce their influence.\n",

    "What this does is to train slightly different \"models\" in each iteration that try to solve your task, preventing the individual filters (neurons) from talking to each other too much and forming overfitting connections.\n",

    "This technique is not dependent on CNNs actually and can also be used with fully-connected neural networks, btw.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Pytorch and CNNs we can specify 2D dropouts or 3D dropouts that zero entire channel outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make the network function properly, we have to be aware, however, whether we are training (dropout should be active) or evaluating (dropout should not be active or have probability zero). In Pytorch, you can control this via the parameters `model.train()` and `model.eval()` for a `nn.Model` subclass like ours."

    "\n",
    "Another idea, published in 2015 by Ioffe and Szegedy, is Batch Normalization - a technique that rescales the inputs to the activation functions of the networks so that each (mini)batch has a desired, nicely-behaving distribution.\n",

Again, as values for the layers are automatically updated with each call, we have to be aware, however, whether we are training (batch norm should be active) or evaluating (batch norm should not be active).

    "What are the advantages of going deep again? Depth allows you to discover hierarchies of features - although a shallow network is in principle - via the Universal Approximation Theorem - capable of solving any task for you, splitting the network into layers enables it to discover hierarchical structures in your data.\n",

    "Example: a shallow network will be able to tell apart birds from airplanes, but a \"deep\" network may be able to tell you that birds and airplanes consist of different parts (wings and bodies in both cases, eyes and legs for birds, windows and perhaps landing gears for airplanes, etc.), hence allowing you to describe the data with more structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why don't we simply go deep? The reason for that was already hinted at several times previously: each additional layer means that gradients in backpropagation will need to be multiplied, and if you are in the tails of the activation functions that will lead to saturation and to either exploding or vanishing gradients, which will make learning unstable or not moving forward.\n",
